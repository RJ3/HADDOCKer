  HADDOCK2.4
  
------------------------------------------------------------------------
### Latest changes - version January 2021

- Added support ASN-BGC glycosilic linkage
- Fixed an issue in which clustering would fail if complexes had too many chains
- Added an extra check for solvated docking and waterdock
- Fixed a bug where simulations would fail if too many ions were restrained
- Improvements, optimizations and fixes to the internal scheduler subroutines


### Latest changes - version September 2020

- Added beta sialic acid (SIB), and additional linkages between glycans
- Added modified DNA baseJ (DJ)
- Corrected issue with automatic his protonation state 
- Added automatic definition of restraints to maintain ions in their coordination sphere.
- Modified analysis scripts to work with a single ligand molecule


### Latest changes - version July 2020

- Added support for glycosylated proteins
- Improved diagnostics
- Reverted the change to scripts to have python2 as environment


### Changes - version June 2020

- Adapted the CG-to-AA conversion script to allow to morph larger conformational changes
  and use secondary structure restraints
- Corrected an issue in automatic secondary structure definition leading failures for very large systems
- Exposed a new parameter in run.cns (flcut_nb) that allows to control the distance cutoff to automatically
  define semi-flexible regions
- All python tools/scripts changed to have python2 as environment (to avoid clashes with python3)

	
### Changes with respect to version 2.2

- Extension to up to 20 molecules docking
- Coarse grained docking implemented based on the Martini force field v2.2
  for both proteins and nucleic acids
- Z-restraining potential as implicit membrane restraining potential
- Cryo-EM restraints implementation
- Added option to turn off (partially) analysis (speeds up the overall running time)
  Default settings only perform clustering
- For refinement (randorien=false), missing atoms are now rebuilt in the context of the complex
- Added automatic identification of cyclic peptides
- Added automatic idenfification of D-amino acids
- Added support for C6 symmetry
- Added support for shapes
- Added option to automatically define HIS protonation states based on electrostatic energy
- Changed default dielectric treatment to distance dependent dielectric with eps=10 for it0 and 1 for it1
  (Note should not be used for nucleic acids and coarse graining)
- Turn off by default explicit solvent final refinement (only EM performed)
- Switched nucleic acid support to use 1/2 letter code for RNA/DNA
- Added option to fix molecules in their original position
