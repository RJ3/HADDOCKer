E2A-HPR docking with NMR CSP data test case
===========================================

AIR definition based on NMR chemical shift perturbation data

Examples run files are:
run_ref_for_patch.cns: docking with AIRs, automatic flexible interface definition


# FOR RUNNING THE TEST
#
# first source the haddock_configure.csh scripts for your version of HADDOCK

source ./run-test.csh >&haddock-protein-protein.out&


# UPDATING THE PATCH FILE - FOR HADDOCK DEVELOPERS

# To create the patch (need to be done only when the default run.cns change too much
# and this is detected when the patch doesn't work anymore, you should:
# 1. Create a normal run1 dir.
# 2. Copy run1/run.cns to run_ref_for_patch.cns
# 3. Edit run_ref_for_patch.cns for the needs of the docking
# 4. Create the patch file:
cd run1
diff -Nur run.cns ../run_ref_for_patch.cns > ../run.cns.patch
