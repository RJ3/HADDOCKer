# FOR HADDOCK USERS

# Examples run files are:

# run.cns-refe: protein-ligand docking with binding site-based AIRs

# Once your haddock run dir is created (for example run1), you will need to edit run1/run.cns.
# This can be done by copying run_ref_for_patch.cns to run1/run.cns 
# and correcting the absolute path used
# This can also be done with a patch that will only modify the necessary lines of run1/run.cns 
# To apply the patch:

cd run1
patch -p0 -i ../run.cns.patch

# Also required: copy the ligand parameter and topology files into the run1/toppar directory
# Use either the acpype of prodrg versions

cp ligand-acpype.param run1/toppar/ligand.param 
cp ligand-acpype.top run1/toppar/ligand.top 

OR:

cp ligand-prodrg.param run1/toppar/ligand.param 
cp ligand-prodrg.top run1/toppar/ligand.top 

# FOR HADDOCK DEVELOPERS

# To create the patch (need to be done only when the default run.cns change too much
# and this is detected when the patch doesn't work anymore, you should:
# 1. Create a normal run1 dir.
# 2. Copy run1/run.cns to run_ref_for_patch.cns
# 3. Edit run_ref_for_patch.cns for the needs of the docking
# 4. Create the patch file:
diff -Nur run.cns ../run_ref_for_patch.cns > ../run.cns.patch
