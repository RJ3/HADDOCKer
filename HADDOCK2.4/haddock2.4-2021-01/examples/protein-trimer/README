1QU9 homotrimer test case
=========================

AIR definition based on whiscy predictions

Examples run files are:

run_ref_for_patch.cns: three body docking with Whiscy interface predictions, automated flexible interface definition


# FOR RUNNING THE TEST 
#
# first source the haddock_configure.csh scripts for your version of HADDOCK
 
source ./run-test.csh >&protein-trimer.diff&

# and when complete, check the protein-trimer.out for differences with the reference run stored in the refe directory


# UPDATING THE PATCH FILE - FOR HADDOCK DEVELOPERS

# To create the patch (need to be done only when the default run.cns change too much
# and this is detected when the patch doesn't work anymore, you should:
# 1. Create a normal run1 dir.
# 2. Copy run1/run.cns to run_ref_for_patch.cns
# 3. Edit run_ref_for_patch.cns for the needs of the docking
# 4. Create the patch file:
cd run1
diff -Nur ./run.cns ../run_ref_for_patch.cns > ../run.cns.patch
