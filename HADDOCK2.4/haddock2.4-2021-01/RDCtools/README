Python scripts written by Wayne Boucher for analysing
residual dipolar coupling data to create vector angle restraints.
Ref: Meiler et al: J. Biomol. NMR Vol 16 pg 245-252 (2000)

********************************************************************						
1. Creation of restraints file:
usage:
python dipolar.py input_file output_file Dxx Dyy Dzz

where input_file format is:

ID	Value		header line - this is *necessary*
6	10.7831		tab de-limited

output_file gives you xplor/cns restraints file.
Restraints are ordered according to how much of the angle between the two
NH vectors has been excluded, with the most restrictive restraints first.
Fraction excluded for each restraints is given as a comment at the end.

When the script is run it tells you how many couplings you have. Check
this to make sure it can find all your data. 

********************************************************************						
2. Comparison to a pdb file:
usage:
python dipolar_pdb.py input_file pdbfile output_file Dxx Dyy Dzz

input file format as above. 

When you run the script it tells you how many dipolar pairs were found and 
how many are OK in the pdb file. 
Uses real pdb format so that NH is called 'H'

Output file has the form:

id1     id2     excluded        pmin1   pmax1   pmin2   pmax2   phi    		 ok

NH(1)	NH(2)	fraction excl.	range of value for phi		actal value	0 if violated
				from vector angles		of phi in pdb	1 if satisfied
								file

dipolar.py		} python scripts
dipolar_pdb.py		}

ras_dmpc.rdb		test input data - dipolar couplings for Ras
ras.pdb			Ras crystal structure (H built using Molmol)
ras_dipolar.out		generated from dipolar.py using :
			Dxx=7.07, Dyy=20.93, Dzz=-28.0
			these numbers came from powder patterns and grid searches
ras_pdb_comp.out	generated from dipolar_pdb.py using same tensor definition
			as above
