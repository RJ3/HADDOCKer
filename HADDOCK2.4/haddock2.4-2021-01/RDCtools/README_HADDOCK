  Residual dipolar couplings (RDCs) can provide useful information on the
  orientation of the two molecules to be docked. They can be introduced in
  HADDOCK in two ways:

    * Directly as RDC restraints (SANI statement in CNS)
    * Indirectly by defining intervector projection angle restraints
      (VEAN statement in CNS)

  From our experience, both approaches give good results for docking. The
  use of intervector projection angle restraints ( Meiler et al. J. Biomol. NMR 17, 185 (2000))
  avoids the burden of working with a tensor in the structure
  calculations. Another advantage is that one can distinguish between
  inter- and intramolecular restraints. Considering that part of the
  system will be typically kept rigid during docking, the use of
  intramolecular restraints might not make much sense anyway.

  For both, the tensor components need first to be determined. In the case
  of complexes, this can be easily done by using the known structures of
  the single domains. The software Pales <http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/PALES/index.html>
  (Zweckstetter & Bax (2000). J. Am. Chem. Soc. 122, 3791-3792) can be used for this purpose.

  You need for this to generate a Pales input file <http://spin.niddk.nih.gov/bax/software/PALES/index.html#DF> 
  containing your residual dipolar couplings.

  A csh script called ana_pdb_Q-factor.csh is provided in the
  haddock/tools directory that will calculate from the experimental
  dipolar coupling the tensor parameters for all PDB files present in the
  current directory by best-fitting the dipolar coupling tensor to the
  corresponding 3D structures.

  Usage:

   $HADDOCK/tools/ana_pdb_Q-factor.csh pales.inp

  The output will be written to files with extension /PDBfilename.pales/.

  The tensor parameters Axx, Ayy and Azz can then be extracted with the
  following command:

    grep Axx *.pales | gawk '{print $4,$5,$6}' > xx-yy-zz.dat

  The components from the structure giving the best fit to the
  experimental data can be used.

  Alternatively, the average values can then be calculated with:

   cat xx-yy-zz.dat | awk '{print $1}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
   cat xx-yy-zz.dat | awk '{print $2}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
   cat xx-yy-zz.dat | awk '{print $3}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl

  Check the values in xx-yy-zz.dat to make sure they match (e.g. same
  sign) before averaging them.
  Similarly, the axial (Da) and rhombic (Dr) components can be extracted
  from the Pales1.2 output files and averaged with the following command:

   grep Da *.pales | awk '{print $3}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl
   grep Dr *.pales | awk '{print $3}' | $HADDOCKTOOLS/average.perl

  Note: For use in HADDOCK (and CNS), the tensor components should be
  expressed in Hertz and the Pales values should be scaled depending on
  the nuclei observed. For example, for N-H residual dipolar coupling the
  proper scaling factor is 21700. Also be careful in the conversion since
  different softwares often use different conventions/notations/units.

  Direct use of RDCs as restraints for docking
  ============================================

  The proper format for RDC restraints is the following:

  assi ( resid 999 and name OO )
       ( resid 999 and name Z  )
       ( resid 999 and name X  )
       ( resid 999 and name Y  )
       ( resid   20 and name N and segid A )
       ( resid   20 and name HN and segid A )   2.981   0.200

  Given a file containing residue_number RDC_value and Segid a RDC
  restraint file in CNS format can be generated with the gawk script
  generate_sani provided in the *HADDOCK/RDCtools* directory:

    $HADDOCK/RDCtools/generate_sani rdc_data_file

  The error on the RDCs is set by default to 0.2 Hz. This can be overruled
  by giving the error value as argument:

    $HADDOCK/RDCtools/generate_sani ERR=0.4 rdc_data_file

  To use RDC restraints in HADDOCK, use SANI in run.cns 
  in the dipolar coupling section and define the proper Da and R
  parameters (R=Dr/Da). The RDC restraints are first used in the rigid
  body energy minimization step using as force constant the value defined 
  for the hot phase. Keep this value small (the current default is 0.02) 
  to keep a proper balance between the AIR and SANI energy terms.

  ------------------------------------------------------------------------

  Intervector projection angle restraints for docking
  ===================================================

  Intervector projection angle restraints ( Meiler et al. J. Biomol. NMR 17, 185 (2000))
  are obtained by taking pairs of residual dipolar couplings and
  generating intervector projection angle restraints (somewhat equivalent
  to dihedral angle restraints). These restraints have the advantage that
  they do no longer depend on the orientation of the dipole vector with
  respect to the alignment tensor. Instead they restrain the angle between
  two dipolar vectors, allowing for two minima. Two force constants must
  be therefore defined: one for the border potential function and one for
  the central part (e.g. between the two minima).

  Thanks to Helen Mott and Wayne Boucher from Cambridge University we are
  providing in the HADDOCK/RDCtools a python script, dipole_segid.py
  that allows the generation of such restraints from RDC data. To use it,
  you need to have your RDC data in a tab separated file containing
  residue_number, RDC_value and Segid and provide the tensor
  components Dxx, Dyy and Dzz (in Hertz). For NH couplings, these
  components are equal to 21700 times the eigenvalues of the Saupe matrix
  given by Pales.

  Usage:

    python $HADDOCK/RDCtools/dipolar_segid.py rdc_data_file vean_output_file Dxx Dyy Dzz

  The resulting restraints file looks like:

    assign (resid 19 and name N and segid     B ) (resid 19 and name HN and segid     B ) (resid 27 and name N and segid     B ) (resid 27 and name HN and segid     B ) 13.1 2.9 166.9 2.9 ! excluded 0.935
    assign (resid 75 and name N and segid     A ) (resid 75 and name HN and segid     A ) (resid 27 and name N and segid     B ) (resid 27 and name HN and segid     B ) 13.1 2.9 166.9 2.9 ! excluded 0.935

  The last column gives the fraction of angular space excluded by the
  restraint and can be used to select "significant" restraints, e.g.
  limiting more than 25% of the torsional space. Note that the number of
  restraints generated is very high since for N dipolar coupling there are
  N*(N-1) possible combinations.

  To select for example all inter- and intramolecular restraint excluding
  more than 25% of the angular space type:

    awk '{if ($27 == $9 && $44 > 0.25) {print $0}}' vean_output_file >vean_intra_25.tbl
    awk '{if ($27 != $9 && $44 > 0.25) {print $0}}' vean_output_file >vean_inter_25.tbl
  
  To use intervector projection angle restraints in HADDOCK, use VANGLE
  in run.cns <run.html#dipo> in the dipolar coupling section. The VANGLE
  restraints are introduced in the rigid body energy minimization step
  using as initial force constants the value defined for the hot phase. 
  The restraints are activated in the second rotational minimization phase 
  (thus earlier than the SANI restraints!)
